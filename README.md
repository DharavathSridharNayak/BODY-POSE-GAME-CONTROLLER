🤸🎮 BODY-POSE-GAME-CONTROLLER

The Body Pose Game Controller is an innovative input system that replaces traditional gamepads and keyboards with full-body motion control. Using AI-powered pose estimation, it detects and tracks key body joints (such as hands, elbows, knees, and feet) to create an immersive, motion-based gaming experience.

Key Features:


✅ Camera-Based Control – Works with standard webcams or depth sensors (e.g., Kinect, Intel RealSense)
✅ Real-Time Pose Detection – Powered by MediaPipe, OpenPose, or MoveNet for accurate body tracking
✅ Custom Gesture Mapping – Define your own gestures for in-game actions (e.g., punch, jump, crouch)
✅ Cross-Platform Support – Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
✅ Low Latency & High Accuracy – Optimized for smooth gameplay
✅ Plug-and-Play Integration – Works with popular game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine, Pygame)

Use Cases:


🎮 Fitness & Exergames – Turn workouts into interactive gaming sessions (e.g., boxing, dance, yoga)
🕶️ VR/AR Experiences – Enhance immersion with full-body tracking
🏥 Rehabilitation & Physical Therapy – Gamify motion exercises for recovery
👶 Interactive Educational Games – Engage kids with movement-based learning
🎯 Motion-Controlled Arcade Games – Play classic games with your body instead of buttons

How It Works:


Camera Input – Captures live video feed from a webcam or depth sensor.

Pose Estimation – AI model (e.g., MediaPipe) detects body keypoints in real-time.

Gesture Recognition – Maps detected poses to game controls (e.g., raising hand = jump).

Game Integration – Sends control signals via keyboard emulation, OSC, or direct SDK integration.
